            "The South Caucasus, a historically complex and geopolitically\nsensitive region, stands at the threshold of unprecedented\nopportunity. Thanks to the renewed and strengthened partnership\nbetween Azerbaijan and the United States, a new era of peace,\nsecurity, and economic cooperation is taking shape. As President\nIlham Aliyev recently emphasized during the III Shusha Global Media\nForum, this relationship is not only grounded in shared interests\nbut also in a robust history of collaboration that promises a\nbright future.",
            "In his address to forum participants, the Azerbaijani leader\nhighlighted the positive signals emanating from Washington,\nreflecting a mutual commitment to elevate ties to higher levels.\n\"We have received very positive messages from Washington — and\nmessages from Azerbaijan have also been very positive,\" President\nAliyev said, underscoring the bilateral goodwill currently\npropelling both countries forward. This mutual positivity is\nessential, particularly in a region where lingering conflicts have\nlong cast shadows over development and cooperation.",
            "Energy security has been a cornerstone of U.S.–Azerbaijani\nrelations. Azerbaijan’s strategic location as an energy corridor\nconnecting Caspian resources to global markets aligns closely with\nU.S. interests in diversifying energy supplies away from unstable\nregions. The President reminded his audience of this historical\npartnership, stating, \"We have a great history of partnership\nin areas related to energy security, security as a whole, and\nissues related to connectivity.\" These words reinforce that\nthe partnership is multi-dimensional — extending beyond\nhydrocarbons to broader security and infrastructural projects that\nconnect not only Azerbaijan and the U.S., but the entire region to\nglobal trade networks.",
            "Moreover, Azerbaijan’s role as a reliable ally in international\nsecurity initiatives has deepened trust. The President pointed out,\n\"We stood with the United States in Iraq and in Afghanistan\nwhen they needed us. Our military servicemen served shoulder to\nshoulder with them.\" This cooperation reflects Azerbaijan’s\ncommitment to global security and peacekeeping, which strengthens\nthe foundation for bilateral ties and opens doors for future\ncollaboration in defense, intelligence sharing, and\ncounterterrorism.",
            "Perhaps most significant is the active involvement of the United\nStates in promoting peace in the South Caucasus. President Aliyev\npraised former President Donald Trump’s engagemen. This\nengagement signals a U.S. willingness to invest diplomatic capital\nin resolving one of the most enduring regional conflicts, which, if\nsuccessful, could unleash transformative economic and social\nbenefits.",
            "The optimism expressed by President Aliyev reflects a wider hope\nthat the normalization process between Azerbaijan and Armenia will\naccelerate. The positive messages from Washington not only\nreinforce U.S. support but also encourage regional actors to seek\npragmatic solutions. The President’s confidence that \"we will have\nmore good news in the future\" is both a promise and a challenge—to\nall stakeholders committed to peace.",
            "Elevating U.S.–Azerbaijani relations also sends a strategic\nmessage to other global powers involved in the region. It shows\nthat the United States values Azerbaijan as a key partner in\nmaintaining stability and securing energy corridors crucial for\nglobal markets. For Azerbaijan, this partnership brings political\nsupport, security guarantees, and access to advanced technologies\nand investment, all vital for its continuing development.",
            "At the same time, Azerbaijan’s active diplomacy and readiness to\ncooperate with major powers underline its role as a constructive\nand sovereign actor shaping its own destiny. The willingness to\nengage with the U.S. on equal terms, based on mutual respect and\nshared goals, creates a sustainable framework for long-term\npartnership.",
            "The evolving U.S.–Azerbaijan relationship marks a positive\nchapter for the South Caucasus. With history as a guide and shared\nstrategic interests as a compass, both nations are set to\nstrengthen cooperation on energy, security, and regional\nconnectivity. President Ilham Aliyev’s vision, as articulated\nduring the Shusha Global Media Forum, reflects a genuine commitment\nto peace and prosperity through partnership. As he put it, \"I\nthink this will be absolutely natural, because a lot of things\nunite us.\" The road ahead may be challenging, but with\ncontinued dialogue and support, Azerbaijan and the United States\ncan lead the way toward a more stable and interconnected\nregion."

The 3rd Shusha\nGlobal Media Forum, scheduled to take place from July 19 to 21,\n2025, is expected to draw over 140 foreign participants from 52\ncountries, including representatives from more than 30\ninternational media agencies, seven global organizations, and\nnearly 80 media outlets.",
            "Held under the theme “Digital Transitions: Strengthening the\nResilience of Information and Mass Media in the Age of Artificial\nIntelligence”, this year's forum aims to serve as a high-level\nplatform for discussing pressing issues such as media resilience,\ndisinformation, the ethical use of artificial intelligence in\njournalism, and the media’s evolving role in a world.",
            "The Shusha Global Media Forum, since its inception in 2023, has\nevolved into one of the most influential media events in the\nregion. Its third iteration will convene policymakers, media\nprofessionals, civil society actors, AI experts, and climate\ncommunication advocates in the symbolic and culturally rich city of\nShusha — a location that embodies Azerbaijan’s post-conflict\nrecovery and international outreach.",
            "By bringing together stakeholders from state, private, and\ninternational sectors, the Forum enables an integrated discussion\non media sustainability, freedom of information, and collaborative\nsolutions to global challenges.",
            "The first forum, held in July 2023, focused on the theme “New\nMedia in the Era of the 4th Industrial Revolution” and tackled\ntopics such as digital transformation, media business models,\njournalist safety, and fake news. It attracted 150 guests from 49\ncountries, laying the foundation for deeper international\ncooperation.",
            "The second forum, in July 2024, addressed “The Fight Against\nDisinformation”, with discussions centered around the spread of\nfake news, the erosion of public trust, and the importance of media\nliteracy. Among the key speakers was Nigar Arpadarai, the UN\nHigh-Level Champion for Climate Change at COP29, who underscored\nthe media's crucial role in climate awareness and action.",
            "Importantly, the 2nd Forum coincided with Azerbaijan's final\npreparations for hosting COP29 in November 2024. That historic\nsummit reinforced Azerbaijan’s image as a hub for environmental\ndiplomacy, and this year’s media forum is expected to reflect on\nmedia narratives shaped during COP29, particularly in terms of\nclimate communication and global media engagement.",
            "Aims and expectations for the 3rd\nForum",
            "The 3rd Forum will explore how artificial intelligence is\ntransforming information flow, newsroom operations, and public\nopinion. At a time when deepfakes, algorithmic bias, and\nAI-generated content are challenging the notion of truth, media\nstakeholders will seek new norms, safeguards, and ethical\nframeworks for digital journalism.",
            "Another core focus will be media resilience—including\ninstitutional independence, financial sustainability, and\ncross-border collaboration in a rapidly fragmenting information\nenvironment.The forum is expected to emphasize fostering practical\ncooperation and developing innovative responses to digital\nthreats",
            "Hosting the 3rd Shusha Global Media Forum in the heart of the\nliberated Garabagh region is symbolically significant. It\nhighlights the country’s commitment to peacebuilding, cultural\ndiplomacy, and technological advancement.",

Covering 190 hectares, it has attracted AZN 270\nmillion in investments so far and houses 30 resident enterprises.\nThese developments signify more than economic growth - they\nrepresent a reintegration of Aghdam into Azerbaijan’s national\neconomic grid.",

            "Azerbaijan is steadily reclaiming its place as a regional\npowerhouse in fertiliser production. Long before the fall of the\nSoviet Union, the country was home to several large chemical and\nfertiliser plants producing ammonium nitrate, urea, and other key\ncomponents that supported not only domestic agriculture but also\nfed the demands of a vast Eurasian supply chain.",
            "The dissolution of the USSR dealt a heavy blow to this proud\nlegacy. Like many industries across the former Soviet space,\nAzerbaijan’s fertiliser production facilities struggled to survive.\nCut off from both the centralised distribution systems and major\nexport markets, the industry gradually withered. Once\nself-sufficient, Azerbaijan became dependent on fertiliser imports,\na significant shift for a country with deep roots in agricultural\nchemistry.",
            "But Azerbaijan never accepted this decline as permanent.\nStarting in the 2010s, the country initiated bold steps to restore\nits industrial capabilities. Several companies were established to\npave the way for a chemical renaissance. However, the true turning\npoint came in January 2019 with the commissioning of the SOCAR\nCarbamide Plant in Sumgait.",
            "This plant was not just a new industrial facility—it was a\nstrategic statement. As one of the most advanced fertiliser\nproduction plants in the region, the Sumgait factory signalled a\nreturn to Azerbaijan’s role as a producer, rather than a passive\nconsumer. The nation did not wait long to witness its fruits. In a\nshort period, Azerbaijan not only became self-sufficient in\nnitrogen fertilisers but also emerged as a rising exporter in the\nglobal market.",
            "By 2022, exports had skyrocketed from $10 million in 2019 to an\nimpressive $200 million. This remarkable growth made nitrogen\nfertilisers one of the leading contributors to Azerbaijan’s non-oil\nexports. It proved that with the right vision, planning, and\nstrategic investment, Azerbaijan could once again compete on the\nglobal stage—not just with oil and gas, but also with high-demand\nagricultural inputs.",
            "Although the global fertiliser market faced turbulence due to\nsupply chain disruptions, rising shipping costs, and logistical\nbottlenecks, Azerbaijan did not sit idly. Instead, the government\nand its strategic partners took decisive action. Through ASCO’s\n(Azerbaijan Caspian Shipping Company) acquisition of several\nhandysize cargo vessels, the nation established more flexible and\nefficient routes between producers and global buyers.",
            "This move was essential. While Asia remains a leading producer\nof nitrogen-based fertilisers, the main importers are located in\nthe Americas. Azerbaijan’s geographical position and logistical\nexpansion now allow it to play a critical role in bridging this\ngap. Soon, Azerbaijan's nitrogen fertiliser exports reclaimed in\n2025. Thus, in the first 6 months, Azerbaijan exported nitrogen\nfertiliser amounting to $98 million. These handysize vessels not\nonly carry Azerbaijani-made fertilisers to distant shores but also\ncontribute to the regional logistics network by transporting\nthird-country products.",
            "Such rapid growth in exports, even amid global headwinds,\nhighlights the strategic value of the fertiliser sector. It is not\nmerely a matter of economics; it is about national sovereignty,\nfood security, and technological resilience. Fertiliser is, in many\nways, a strategic commodity. Agriculture around the world—and by\nextension, the entire food chain—depends on its availability.",
            "Azerbaijan’s renewed investment in this sector demonstrates not\nonly foresight but also a deep commitment to long-term stability\nand self-reliance. As global concerns over food insecurity continue\nto rise, countries that control key agricultural inputs will shape\nthe geopolitical and economic conversations of the future.",
            "The story of Azerbaijan’s fertiliser sector is one of revival,\nvision, and determination. From the ashes of a collapsed Soviet\nsystem, Azerbaijan has built a new foundation—one that combines\nhistorical expertise with modern technology. The SOCAR Carbamide\nPlant stands as a symbol of this transformation, proving that\nstrategic planning and national pride can restore what was once\nlost.",
            "Today, Azerbaijan is not merely producing for its own needs. It\nis exporting knowledge, stability, and opportunity to the world.\nWith rising global demand for fertilisers, especially in regions\nwhere food production is vulnerable, Azerbaijan’s contributions\ncarry immense weight.",
            "More importantly, this journey illustrates a larger truth: that\nAzerbaijan is capable of taking its future into its own hands,\ninvesting in its strengths, and emerging as a reliable partner in\nan increasingly uncertain world. The fertiliser industry may seem\nsilent, but its power is undeniable. And Azerbaijan is once again\nleading with confidence."
